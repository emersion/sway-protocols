  <description summary="a frame ready for readout">
    An interface to capture surfaces in an efficient way.
    Overall usage:

    1.) client registers with zwlr_screencontent_manager
    2.) server sends client info about surfaces via "receive_surface_info"
    3.) client subscribes to capture a surface via the "capture" request
    4.) server sends client events via the "zwlr_screencontent_frame" interface
    5.) client finishes and informs server via the "destroy" event
  </description>

  <interface name="zwlr_screencontent_frame" version="1">
    <description summary="a frame ready for readout">
      This object represents a frame which is ready to have its resources
      fetched and used.

      The receive callback shall be called first, followed by either the
      "receive_object" callback once per object or the "receive_layer" callback,
      once per layer. The "receive_plane" callback shall only be called after
      the "receive_layer" callback corresponding to the layer the plane belongs
      to has been called. Finally, the "ready" event is called to indicate that
      all the data has been made available for readout, as well as the time
      at which presentation happened at.
      The ownership of the frame is passed to the client, who's responsible for
      destroying it once ready.
      The data the API describes has been based off of what
      VASurfaceAttribExternalBuffers contains.
      All frames are read-only and may not be written into or altered.

    <enum name="frame_flags">
      <description summary="frame flags">
        Special flags that must be respected by the client.
        Transient frames indicate short lifetime frames (such as swapchain
        images from external clients). Clients are advised to copy them and do
        all processing outside of the "ready" event.

      This object is a manager which informs clients about capturable windows

      from. The "title" argument in the "receive_surface_info" event shall be
      used to provide a user-readable identifier such as a window title or
      program name.
      To begin capturing, use the "capture" request with an ID. Additionally,
      to capture a cursor surface, use the "cursor" argument with a non-zero
      value. If a client has no cursor or cursor is unable to be captured,
      the "capture" request shall return NULL.
      The client can specify which frame type would be preferred using the
      "type" argument. If a compositor is unable to provide frames with a given
      type, NULL shall be returned. The client is welcome to retry with another
      frame type.
